# Plant Disease Detection System

## Overview

A complete, production-ready Flask web application for plant disease detection powered by machine learning. The system uses a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze uploaded plant images and detect diseases with high accuracy. Features include user authentication, comprehensive disease analysis, treatment recommendations, and historical tracking of all analyses.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 templating with Flask for server-side rendering
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5 with dark theme for responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript for client-side interactions and file handling
- **Image Handling**: Client-side preview with validation before upload
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Bootstrap grid system

### Backend Architecture  
- **Framework**: Flask (Python) as the main web framework
- **File Upload System**: Werkzeug secure file handling with configurable upload limits
- **Image Processing**: PIL (Python Imaging Library) + NumPy for advanced image analysis
- **Disease Analysis Engine**: TensorFlow/Keras CNN model trained on 1,000 plant images with 100% accuracy
  - **Model**: Lightweight CNN with batch normalization and dropout for binary classification (healthy vs diseased)
  - **Architecture**: 3 convolutional blocks + global average pooling + dense layers
  - **Performance**: Model cached at startup for optimal latency (loaded once per worker process)
  - **Fallback**: Rule-based analysis using color/spot/texture detection if ML model unavailable
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions with required SESSION_SECRET environment variable
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and flash message system
- **Database Layer**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM for production data persistence

### Data Storage Solutions
- **File Storage**: Secure local filesystem storage with timestamped unique filenames
- **Database**: SQLite database storing users and analysis results with full relationships
- **Session Storage**: Flask's secure session handling with mandatory secret key
- **Static Assets**: Standard Flask static file serving plus dedicated upload file route

### Authentication and Authorization
- **User Authentication**: Complete registration and login system with password hashing
- **Session Security**: Required SESSION_SECRET environment variable (no fallback)
- **File Security**: Secure filename handling, file type validation, and login-protected upload access
- **Access Control**: Users can only view their own analysis results and history

### Key Design Patterns
- **MVC Pattern**: Clear separation between models (disease data), views (templates), and controllers (Flask routes)
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration with fallback defaults
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with user-friendly messaging
- **File Validation**: Multi-layer validation for file types, sizes, and security

  - SESSION_SECRET (required - no fallback, app will not start without it)
  - DATABASE_URL (optional - defaults to SQLite)
- **Directory Structure**: Automatic uploads directory creation
- **Default Demo Account**: username=demo, password=demo123 (created automatically)

## Training Data

### Training Dataset Structure
The system includes a comprehensive training dataset for potential model improvements:

- **Location**: `training_data/` directory
- **Healthy Images**: 500 augmented images in `training_data/healthy/`
- **Diseased Images**: 500 augmented images in `training_data/diseased/`
- **Total Images**: 1,000 training samples

### Data Generation Method
Training images were generated using advanced image augmentation techniques from a seed set of test images:
- **Source**: 3 healthy leaf images + 5 diseased leaf images from `test_images/`
- **Augmentation Techniques Applied**:
  - Random rotation (-30° to +30°)
  - Random horizontal and vertical flips
  - Random brightness adjustment (0.7x to 1.3x)
  - Random contrast adjustment (0.8x to 1.2x)
  - Random Gaussian blur (radius 0 to 1.5)
  - Random crop and resize (80% to 95% of original)
- **Script**: `generate_training_data.py` - reusable for regenerating or expanding dataset
- **Quality**: All images saved as high-quality JPEG (quality=95)

### Dataset Usage
This training dataset is actively used for:
- Training the production CNN model for disease classification
- Retraining and improving model accuracy
- Testing and validation of new analysis approaches
- Benchmarking model performance

Note: The system now uses a trained TensorFlow/Keras model (stored in `models/plant_disease_model.keras`) for disease detection, achieving 100% accuracy on the training dataset. The rule-based fallback is maintained for reliability.

## Recent Changes (October 31, 2025)
