CLASS MAPPING FOR MODEL:
==================================================
diseased = 0
healthy = 1

PREDICTION INTERPRETATION:
==================================================
Model output close to 0 = diseased
Model output close to 1 = healthy

CODE LOGIC:
if prediction > 0.5: disease = 'healthy'
else: disease = 'diseased'
